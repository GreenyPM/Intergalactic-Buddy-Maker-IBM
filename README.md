 This is a Python Picture Creation Application using ChatGPT's embedded API
 This program was made Utilizing the Tkinter Library across the span of 2 weeks in College.
 The initial plan was to re-create a program I made during my 3rd semester called the "Gotcha Own Waifu".
 The project proved too narrow of a vision for me to include in the Comic-Con, so I went back to the drawing board and came up with this idea.

 This at its base is a GUI prompt-entry application utilizing the ChatGPT Dall-E API. 
 The conversion process in the code is quite complex as the image has to be converted from a JSON file to a JPG.<br>
